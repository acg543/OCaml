# Question 3 - record your answers with one space after each numbered bullet below:

1. My favorite topic we covered this term was tail recursion. It helped me gain a better understanding of how to optimize code and how OCaml itself works.

2. The proofs. The lab was very open ended.

3. The midterm was very difficult. I felt that the wording for a lot of the problems was very arbitrary and it was hard to understand was what actually supposed to be done.
